This study compares the performance of various popular artificial intelligence techniques such as breadth-first search,
depth-first search, A* search, IDA, and Greedy Best-First Search using the N-Puzzle problem. The goal is to evaluate the
complexity exhibited by each algorithm in reaching a solution and determine which technique is more effective in different scenarios.
The N-Puzzle problem is utilized as a test scenario, and an application is created for each algorithm to obtain results. 
This article aims to demonstrate the progress level of each algorithm
in the solution process and explain specific situations where each technique might be preferred.
